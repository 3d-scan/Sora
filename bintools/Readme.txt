A number of useful tools have been added in the depot.

1) Oscilloscope for 11b

This is an old tool. I think everyone should know how to use it.

2) Oscilloscope for 11a

This is an updated tool compared to the previous versions (dubbed as 
sdroma-latest.exe). The main fix is to handle large central frequency 
offset (CFO) when receiving. You can identify this version from previous 
version by looking for the estimated CFO (in KHz) in the general info panel.

3) signal viewer

A simple viewer for our signal dump file. It is also a handly cutting tool.
You can zoom in/out using down/up arrows. You can also set the start mark by 
clicking, and the end mark with shift + click. This way, you can select a 
portion of signal samples and save to a separate file. 

4) Sora View

It is yet another oscilloscope, a console-based windows program. 
It is programmed using Bricks and shows more information.
