The Microsoft Research Software Radio (Sora) is a fully programmable software radio platform based on the commodity multicore CPU in a host PC. With Sora, researchers and engineers can quickly prototype new, high-speed wireless physical and media-access-control layers with a minimum of effort. Microsoft Research Software Radio SDK provides the BRICK model for baseband programming, user mode 802.11a/b/n samples, and a full new debug plot tool. Windows 10 is fully supported.
